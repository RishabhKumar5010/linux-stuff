## Why this script exists ?
R default desktop launcher looks bad.\
The default launcher simply executes a command "**R**"\
Now the default R command prints version, licensing and other info,\
which to me as a user is not required everytime I need the tool\

This script only keeps R version info,\ 
adds a welcome text for `$USER`\
and a prompt for *q() to quit*  #which is handy if you are used to saving workspace before exit.


## How to Execute

First run a **chmod +x** on the script file in this repo. \
eg. `chmod +x Rdesktop.sh` 

Now open default **R.desktop** file. \
Replace the default command 'R' with the absolute path of this script in EXEC section of the desktop file or\
simply in the command section in a GUI based desktop file edior.

### If you don't have access to R.desktop
it's usually present in `/usr/share/applications` \
at least when you have installed R properly on your system and haven't messed up.

Anyways you can have a look on this link on template of `.desktop` files\
https://developer.gnome.org/integration-guide/stable/desktop-files.html.en \
and create one yourself.
